Question 1:
This is an inclass activity where a weather service client-server application needs to be designed. There are two executable files in the git the ./server and the ./client. 
When running these it will provide 4 city options for the client. For instance if the client enters Victoria it will communicate with the server requesting the weather forcast for
that city. The server will then provide the description of the weather forcast for Victoria. If the city does not exist then it will inform the client that the city does not exist
for the list of options provided. The client could also exit the program by entering exit and it will gracefully terminate itself and disconnect from the server. 

Question 2:
Is the library database management system. The task is to create a simple Library Database Management System using a C program that connects to a MySQL database. The ./library_db.sql file
holds the database for the books. Which would also call the database ./library_db. The library_db file allows you to coonnect to the MySQL database. The file also allows you to add books to the 
catalog, view books, search books, and exit the program.
